chess.py
==============================

Classic chess in Python (using pygame).
It isn't 100% complete, but it's pretty much playable. After each move, the board is reversed so that the other player can make a move.
I've also made an online multiplayer version, but it doesn't work very well, so I'd like to work on it a little bit more before publishing it.
